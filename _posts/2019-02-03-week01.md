Open Sour
What are some advantages of open vs. closed source, what are some potential problems with open source, why did you decide to register for a class about open source software development?


projects: list names of four open source projects that you regularly use or that influenced you in some way in the past; give brief descriptions for each, explain why you use it and what the alternatives might be (note, the projects do not have to be source code based) (Keep in mind that these blogs are publicly available to anybody who stumbles upon them. Make sure that the posts are appropriate.)
